ROCm installation:
```
pip install --ignore-installed torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.1

HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0 python main.py classifier -t
```

To run the application it is necessary to copy `example.config.py` and rename it to `config.py`.

The work which is supposed to be done is defined in `main.py` with explicit mention of generator functions.

The ontology has several versions:
1. Raw version without interface to interact (without class restrictions and with messy object properties),
1. Same version with interface,
1. New version of ontology (`ontology2`) which has class restrictions, less amount of object properties and more meaningful ones.

- The `ontology` folder contains ontology scheme and interface,
- The `ontology2` folder contains ontology2 scheme and interface,
- The `queries` folder in `ontology` and `ontology2` contains queries` definitioins,
- The `resources` folder contains query results, datasets, generated ontologies.
- The `annotations_builder` folder contains algorithms for ontology creation with provided annotations,
- The `classifier_builder` folder contains algorithms for automatic ontology creation,
- The `manual_builder` folder in `ontology` and `ontology2` contains manually created ontologies,
- The `docs` folder contains documentation for the ontology


TODO
----
